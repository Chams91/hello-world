# hello-world
it's my first git repository.. just wanted to get lost in its maze by creating it :p
Now you know that discovering Git can be a horror for a student like me.. but sincerley it doesn't feel like that once you're officially into it :)
pull request aren't really working.. didn't know how to enbale it?!!
