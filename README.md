# hello-world
it's my first git repository.. just wanted to get lost in its maze by creating it :p
Now you know that discovering Git can be a horror for a student like me.. but sincerley it doesn't feel like that once you're officially into it :)
pull request aren't really working.. didn't know how to enbale it?!!

gonna change a few things now!!

just discovered that the tuto in the git doesn't mention that you should select the second option in order to pull new requests and merging it to master.
